Introduction
------------
some basic console stuff, probably thinking of roguelike-features.
Uses conio2 from http://conio.sourceforge.net/[here], I just fetched the 
source package and unpacked it, edit the first line in makefile to point 
it to the correct location.

Usage
-----
after starting the test exe, there's a nice @ squiggly. 

* WASD moves the squiggly
* TAB enters command mode. 

command mode:
+++++++++++++
All commands are typed in lowercase

* 'editor' starts the editor
* 'hack' starts the roguelike
* 'quit' quits.

editor
++++++

* typing inserts characters, enter goes to the next line
* ESC escapes to command mode
* Ctrl-S enters 'save file' dialog, where you may save the current buffer.
* Ctrl-B prints the most recently written line as binary.
* Ctrl-D prints binary string as characters

hack
++++
* Ctrl-Q quits
